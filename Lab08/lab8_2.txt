a. 

   i. The component structure (a tree of components) makes the UI composable. 

   React is highly depend on composable components.

   ii. JSX enables to write JavaScript similar to XML. It is easier to

   read than writing plain JavaScript. 

   iii. React is safe because XSS protection is the default.

   In addition, it does not produce HTML strings. 

   iv. The comment first loaded by making a comment box which can stores data inside with

   a specified data type; then, it get the comment from the server. At last, it is saved by the function inside the comment box. 

   v. Props can be used to read the data passed to the box and render markup. 

   State is the state setting of a component. When it is updated, the component re-renders itself.



b. i. When I delete one list information about a comment and refreshes the page, it imediately updates the page. Because reacts enables to check the file everytime we refreshes the page. 
      If I delete author and text leaving id, it gives me error becuase there is no children to display. 
   
   ii. Because it should be appeared after it makes sure there is a comment to display

   iii. The user can always get the current updated version of the data and does not cause confusion due to a gap of information between the current data and the displayed data.
   iv. There is a risk that the server can be disfunction with variuos reasons but optimism can be used to enhance the user experience.
